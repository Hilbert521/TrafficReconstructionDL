Code for the paper "Deep-learning-based State Reconstruction of a Scalar Hyperbolic PDE under Lagrangian Sensing"

The file godunov.py stimulates the problem using a godunoc numerical scheme.
The file main.py is the main file, the one to launch.
The file neural_network.py is a class for general neural network purposes (using Tensorflow).
The file reconstruction_neural_network.py is a class that uses neural_network.py to create a reconstruction neural network.
